# CPU_Scheduling
CPU scheduling is a process of determining which process will  own CPU(Central Processing Unit) for execution and for what time and in what order
  while another process is on hold. The main task of CPU scheduling is to make sure that whenever the CPU remains idle, the OS(Operating System) atleast
  select one of the processes available in the ready queue for execution. 
  </br>The selection process will be carried out by the CPU scheduler.
  It selects one of the processes in memory that are ready for execution.
